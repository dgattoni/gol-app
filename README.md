# Game of Life

### Rules

- Assume a fixed size board, eg 80 columns by 20 rows
- To start the game, randomly set each cell on the board either ON or OFF
- Print the status of the board to the screen
- Enter an infinite loop:
- Wait half a second
- Produce a new "tick" of the board
- Print the status of the board to the screen
- The wikipedia article linked above describes the rules for each "tick":

## Dependencies

### Tools and libraries

- JAVASCRIPT (ES6)

### To improve:

- Serve app on ExpressJS to run index on Localhost.
- Add babel for es6 imports.
- Separation of concerns on functions (create utility functions) for better maintainability.
- Use JS prototype approach to create a Cell element.
- Improve code using a more declarative approach on coding.
- Add a Test layer (eg chai)
- Customize grid to work with any rows/cols number.
- Add Game instructions.
- Improve documentation on functions input/output.
